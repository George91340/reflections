When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you are working on a project with a team or would like to have access to your personal project across
	several of your own machines. Also, you would use a remote repository when you would like to share your project
	with the public.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote respository?

	It is a better idea to pull changes from your remote repository manually instead of automatically
	because you might not want to have everything on your local machine to be made public if it is not 
	ready to be deployed.
