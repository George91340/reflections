When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you are working on a project with a team or would like to have access to your personal project across
	several of your own machines. Also, you would use a remote repository when you would like to share your project
	with the public.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote respository?

	It is a better idea to pull changes from your remote repository manually instead of automatically
	because you might not want to have everything on your local machine to be made public if it is not 
	ready to be deployed.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Branches is an action taken on a the same repository, all of the files are copied under a different
	commit label. Cloning and forking a repository is very similar, the difference being that forking is
	a tool on Github and it is used specifically for cloning an exising GitHub project into your own 
	profile. You would want to use fork when you would like to access someone else's project on GitHub
	who you do not have commit access to. You would use cloning in all other cases.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	If you have a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally, you can work offline and have
	those changes accessible to you. You can also run a diff to see what has changed so far compared to your
	current working state.
