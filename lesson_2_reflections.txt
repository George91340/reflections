What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	A .git file is created that contains metadata used by git to manage the repository. 
	We need to initialize it so that we can tell git to keep track of all the changes made.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the respository? What value 
do you think it offers?

	The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository because it acts 
	as an intermediary between the two. You can select which files from your current working directory
	you would like to add to your repository. The value offered by this feature is that it allows the 
	user to select which files you would like to add to each specific commit so that you can create
	smaller, logical commits if you so desire.
